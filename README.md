# Game-of-Life

This is a simple c++ program to simulate [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).
For current simulations we are using the [Gosper Glider Gun generator](http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Gosper_glider_gun).

# Notes:
- Compile and Run gameOfLife.cpp to start the simulations.
- Please use c++11.
